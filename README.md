# Spatio-Temporal_Strategies

## 1) Clustering
This folder contains the Excel file ‘r_&_Z_values’, which reports the correlation coefficients (r) and their corresponding Z-transformed values for each computed between the following variable pairs: Strike Duration & Impact Speed, Strike Duration & Strike Amplitude, and Impact Speed & Strike Amplitude.
The Statistica files ‘Z-values_Kmean-3’ include the spreadsheets and the results of the clustering analysis (k-means, k = 3) performed on the Z-transformed data

## 2)  Regression 3D
This folder contains the MATLAB code (Script_Plot_3D_Regression) used to generate 3D regression plot based on the data provided in the Excel file. The ‘Figure’ subfolder includes the resulting 3D regression plots in various formats.

## 3) Regression 1-Participant Each cluster
This folder contains regression plots for three individual participants, each representing a different cluster. The figures are available in various formats.

## 4) PCA
This folder contains the results of the Principal Component Analyses (PCA) conducted separately for each of the three clusters using JASP. The initial data are contained in CSV files.

## 5) Coefficient of Variation
This folder includes the ANOVA analysis related to the coefficient of variation for the following movement parameters:
- **Strike Amplitude**: `Stat_Coefficient-Variation_Strike_Amplitude` (JASP and CSV files)  
- **Impact Speed**: `Stat_Coefficient-Variation_Impact_Speed` (JASP and CSV files)  
- **Strike Duration**: `Stat_Coefficient-Variation_Duration` (JASP and CSV files)

## 6) Cluster Performance
This folder contains the ANOVA results on spatial error across the three clusters, in the JASP file ‘Clusters_Performance’. It also includes the Excel and CSV datasets used for the JASP analysis.

## 7) Independence Spatio-temporal & Motor Strategies
This folder includes the Excel spreadsheet containing the Chi-square analysis assessing the independence between spatiotemporal strategies and motor coordination strategies.
